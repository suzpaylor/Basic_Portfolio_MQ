            <p>Let's go back to 1984 and <a class="links" href="http://www.cloudpaint.com/classic">the very first version
                    of MacPaint </a> on an original Macintosh PC. I spent hours on this program creating all sorts of creatures,
                completely mesmorized with the technology! Fast-foward 15 years, to my first 'real' job at a Molecular Genetics
                lab. The work was always exciting... but to be honest I found the most satisfaction in teaching myself how
                to take images from a microscope to Adobe Photoshop for<a href="http://dev.biologists.org/content/133/24/4957.short">
                    publication</a>. Through lots of trial and error I became the local Photoshop expert. Since that time,
                the kitchen has become my laboratory and home of the Bonneville Bakery and my favorite recipes are recorded
                on <a href="http://www.suzdaily.com/">suzdaily.com</a>. I love spending time with my family - baking, decorating,
                skiing, gardening, hiking and enjoying all that these beautiful mountains have to offer. I am beyond excited
                to break-up with WordPress, finish this UofU Bootcamp strong and re-enter the workforce with the skills of
                a Web Developer.</p>
